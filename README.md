A minimalist drum-roll style clock built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The main goal of this challenge was to create a fully functional and visually "clean" clock using as little code as possible.
It was a test to see how far I could push simplicity and optimization while maintaining clear structure.
